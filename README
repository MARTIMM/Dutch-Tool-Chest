INTRODUCTION

The Dutch Tool Chest is a series of scripts I found usefull. The tools are
ordered into catagories where it might belong.


CATAGORY
  File modifications
  ------------------

    removeHardTabs.pl file|directory {...}
      Removes and substitutes the hardtabs into spaces in every text found file

    substitute.pl search-word replacement-word directory|File {...}
      Subsitute a word with another in every found text file



  Module checkup
  --------------

    scrutinize.pl   (use -h to get info)
      Using a file Project.yml checks the software for failures and will
      critisize your software. It makes use of the known programs/libraries
      Perl::Critic and App::Prove.



  Module information
  ------------------

    getInstalledModuleList.pl
      Searches for every installed module using @INC and writes the information
      into a file ModuleList.Perl-x.y.z.txt where x.y.z is the current version.


BUGS

Documentation is not available for the scrutinize program to help with the
setup of the Project.yml file.
